# üñºÔ∏è Attention-Guided-Vision-Language-Modeling-for-Image-and-Video-Captioning

This repository presents an advanced image captioning framework that generates detailed and context-aware captions by combining transformer-based encoders and attention-enhanced decoders. It leverages visual and relational cues in the image to improve caption quality and generalization.

---

## üìå Overview

This model integrates:

- **BLIP Visual Encoder**: Extracts high-level semantic features from the image
- **GPT-2 Language Decoder**: Generates fluent and descriptive text
- **Scene Attention**: Captures holistic scene-level context
- **Object Attention**: Focuses on detailed object-specific features
- **Graph Interaction Attention**: Models relationships between objects using similarity-based graph reasoning

The combination improves both visual understanding and linguistic coherence.

## üõ† Features

- Transformer-based vision-language architecture
- Fine-grained and contextual attention modules
- Supports MSCOCO, NoCaps, and custom datasets
- Evaluation using CIDEr, BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and SPICE
- Modular design for easy extension and experimentation

## üì¶ Precomputed Dataset Features

Due to file size limitations, the `.pkl` feature files for the ViT visual embeddings are hosted on Google Drive.
